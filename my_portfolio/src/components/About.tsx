          With a background in marketing and brand management, I&apos;ve always
          been passionate about storytelling and user experience. After
          relocating to Denmark, I decided to turn that passion into a new path
          â€” Full-Stack development.
          <br />
          <br />
          I&apos;ve since gained hands-on experience with JavaScript, React,
          Node.js, and SQL, and I'm currently expanding my skills through UI/UX
          design. I love building clean, intuitive interfaces and crafting
          digital experiences that connect people and ideas.
